## Premier

Premier is a tiny, demo iOS application, replicated in both Objective-C and Swift.

It presents a list of top movies according to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org), by querying their API. The full details of the API can be found in [The Movie Database API documentation](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

### Getting started

Xcode 8 is needed to build and run the apps. Both the Objective-C and Swift projects are built against iOS 10, targeting iOS 9.3. The Swift project uses Swift 3.
